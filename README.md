GrowHub IoT System is an advanced platform for real-time monitoring and management of hydroponic crops. It captures and processes four critical variables‚Äîtemperature, pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and Electrical Conductivity (EC)‚Äîessential for maintaining optimal growing conditions. The system integrates data mining techniques to transform raw analog signals from sensors into structured JSON objects, ready for analysis and decision-making.

Sensor readings are dynamically processed in C++ and encapsulated into JSON objects, transmitted via MQTT every 4‚Äì8 seconds. These objects undergo serialization, deserialization, cleaning, and standardization to ensure data consistency and reliability. A Python microservice, built with Flask, manages the data pipeline, storing the cleaned JSON objects into NoSQL databases hosted on AWS (Mongo) and GCP (Firebase).

GrowHub's modular architecture and real-time visualizations powered by Plotly enable farmers to monitor trends, identify issues, and optimize their operations. This seamless integration of IoT, cloud technologies, and data processing establishes GrowHub as a key tool for precision and sustainable agriculture.

### üß† Project Context and Development Journey

GrowHub IoT is the culmination of a long and intensive journey of research, learning, and development. As a one-man army, I have single-handedly designed, implemented, and tested every aspect of this project. This public release represents a polished version derived from a private repository with over 100+ commits, reflecting countless hours of experimentation, coding, debugging, and iteration.

While many functionalities are operational, not all have been developed to the level of refinement I originally envisioned. Some features remain partially implemented due to time constraints, while others are potential ideas that I couldn't explore, such as predictive analytics through neural networks to provide recommendations for crop management. The result is a functional and modular system, but also a testament to the challenges and opportunities in working as a solo developer on a multidisciplinary project.

GrowHub is not just a software solution; it is a Research and Development (R&D) project with environmental and social goals. Throughout this process, I delved into topics far beyond software development, studying agricultural sciences and biotechnology to understand the intricacies of hydroponic systems. This learning journey included evaluating technologies that ultimately did not make it into GrowHub due to compatibility or feasibility issues. The system you see today is the outcome of this exploration‚Äîa balance between ambition, technical constraints, and a commitment to creating a meaningful tool for sustainable agriculture.

### Requirements
Ensure the following are available for deploy:
- We strongly recommend to use Linux machine and a **Conda environment** with Python 3.7 or higher.
- Booteable MicroSD with Raspberry Pi OS (or any other 32-bit ARM Debian-based distribution, like 'Twister OS')
- At least one ESP8266MOD compatible with Arduino IDE to flashing GrowHub firmware (more information on 'Hardware Setup' below).
- Network infrastructure with a dedicated Access Point or a physical router acting as a switch to ensure robust MQTT communication between devices.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rmardonesa/growhub.git
   cd growhub
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env
   ```

4. **Initialize the Database**
   ```sh
   python init_db.py
   ```

5. **Run the Application**
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
   Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`.

<details>
  <summary>üí° Advanced Configuration</summary>
  <br>
  To check the status of the Flask application and run it with specific options, use the following commands

  View Flask Logs:
  ```sh
   tail -f flask.log
   ```
  Run Flask:
  
  ```sh
   flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
   ```

  Database Configuration
  
  *The default SQLite database provided by the software is basic and just a template. Users can enhance its complexity after running init_db.py. For example, you can add more tables, indexes, or migrate to a more robust database system like PostgreSQL or MySQL.*
  <br>
  Migrate to PostgreSQL:
  ```sh
  pg_dump -U postgres -d old_db > old_db.sql
  psql -U postgres -d new_db < old_db.sql
   ```
